# BluetoothAPI
 Tiny proof-of-concept node.js API that exposes bluetooth state over the network. Built in a weekendâ„¢.

**NOTE: Written in early 2019.**

This is built to run on a Raspberry Pi, embedded inside an analogue turntable. There is hardcoded checks currently for bluetooth devices that particular device is supposed to know about. 

I made use of some public regex checks for the underlying bluetoothctl communication, and no longer can find the source. As such, this project is unlicensed.
