# BluetoothAPI
 Tiny proof-of-concept node.js API that exposes bluetooth state over the network. Built in a weekendâ„¢.

This is built to run on a Raspberry Pi, embedded inside an analogue turntable. There is hardcoded checks currently for bluetooth devices that particular device is supposed to know about.
